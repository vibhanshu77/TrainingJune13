Jay – Hello? Am I talking to Prateek Agarwal?

Prateek – Hello. Yes, I am Prateek Agarwal. May I ask who is speaking?

Jay – Prateek, it’s me Jay Roy from college. Remember?

Prateek – Hey Jay, how are you? It has been such a long time.

Jay – I am doing good. Yes, four long years after college. I got your contact number from Piyush. You remember him, right?

Prateek – Yes, yes, I do remember him. Wasn’t he the one who topped our engineering batch last year?

Jay – Yes, that’s him! He’s in Boston working for a big MNC now.

Prateek – Wow! Good for him.

Jay – The main reason I called you up is because I am planning to organise a reunion of our batch and wanted to know if you could make it.

Prateek – Really? Yes, I would love to attend the reunion. Just let me know the time and venue.

Jay – Do you remember the auditorium of our college where we had our orientation program?

Prateek – How can I forget that auditorium? We all have spent so much time in that place over the years.

Jay – That’s the place for our reunion. I called up the college regarding this and they gave us permission to have the reunion there. In fact, some of our professors might also be there. I’ve sent out invitations to them too.

Prateek – Splendid! I am eagerly looking forward to the reunion.

Jay – I have to contact a few others too. I will let you know the details within two days. Meet you soon. Bye

Prateek – Sure, Bye.
